}
\arguments{
\item{minsplit}{The minimum observations in a node before a split is attempted}

\item{minbucket}{The minimum number of observations in a terminal node.}

\item{maxdepth}{Set the maximum depth in the final tree. A root node is counted as a height of 0.}

\item{maxobsMtxCalc}{Optional maximum number of observations in a node where computationally intensive matrix calculations like autocorrelation and compactness are performed.}

\item{distpower}{The power of inverse distance to use when calculating spatial weights matrix.}

\item{islonglat}{Are the coordinates longitude and latitude coordinates? If TRUE, then use great circle distance calculations}

\item{givePredAsFactor}{In the returned autocart model, should the prediction vector also be returned as a factor?}

\item{retainCoords}{After creating the autocart model, should the coordinates for each of the predictions be kept in the returned model?}

\item{useGearyC}{Should autocart use Geary's C instead of Moran's I in the splitting function?}

\item{runParallel}{Logical value indicating whether autocart should run using parallel processing.}

\item{spatialWeightsType}{What type of spatial weighting should be used when calculating spatial autocorrelation? Options are "default" or "gaussian".}

\item{customSpatialWeights}{Use this parameter to pass in an optional spatial weights matrix for use in autocorrelation calculations. Must have nrow and ncol equal to rows in training dataframe.}

\item{spatialBandwidthProportion}{What percentage of the maximum pairwise distances should be considered the maximum distance for spatial influence? Cannot be simultaneously set with \code{spatialBandwidth}}

\item{spatialBandwidth}{What is the maximum distance where spatial influence can be assumed? Cannot be simultaneously set with \code{spatialBandwidthProportion}.}

\item{asForest}{A logical indicating if the tree should be created as a forest component with random subsetting of predictors at each node. Set this to true if you are using this tree inside an ensemble.}

\item{asForestMTry}{An integer indicating the number of predictor variables to subset at each node of the tree.}
}
\value{
An object passed in to the \code{autocart} function that controls the splitting.

\examples{
# Load some data for an autocartControl example
snow <- na.omit(read.csv(system.file("extdata", "ut2017_snow.csv", package = "autocart")))
y <- snow$yr50
X <- data.frame(snow$ELEVATION, snow$MCMT, snow$PPTWT)
locations <- as.matrix(cbind(snow$LONGITUDE, snow$LATITUDE))

# Create a control object that disallows the tree from having a depth more
# than 10 and give spatial weights only to observations that are a third of the
# distance of the longest distance between any two points in the dataset.
snow_control <- autocartControl(maxdepth = 10, spatialBandwidthProportion = 0.33)

# Pass the created control object to an autocart model
snow_model <- autocart(y, X, locations, 0.30, 0, snow_control)
