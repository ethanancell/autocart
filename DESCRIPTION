Description: A modified version of the classification and regression tree (CART) 
    algorithm for modelling spatial data that features coordinate information.
    Coordinate information can be used to evaluate measures of spatial
    autocorrelation and spatial compactness during the splitting phase of the
    tree, leading to better predictions are more physically realistic predictions
    on these types of datasets.
